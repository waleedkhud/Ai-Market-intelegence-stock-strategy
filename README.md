Sentiment-Based Trading Strategy README
=======================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains a Python script designed to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using OpenAI's API and NewsAPI. The sentiment analysis results are intended to be used as a basis for a trading strategy in TradingView through Pine Script. The script fetches news articles, analyzes their sentiment, and computes an average sentiment score that can be used to make informed trading decisions.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can use this script, you need the following:

-   Python 3.x installed on your system.
-   An API key from OpenAI (GPT-3).
-   An API key from NewsAPI.
-   Basic understanding of Python and Pine Script.

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files directly.

    bashCopy code

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

2.  Install Dependencies: Navigate to the directory where the script is located and install the required Python libraries.

    bashCopy code

    `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai newsapi-python`

3.  API Keys Configuration: Enter your OpenAI and NewsAPI keys in the script.

    pythonCopy code

    `# Set your OpenAI API key
    openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

    # Set your NewsAPI key
    newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='your-newsapi-key')`

Usage
-----

1.  Running the Script: Execute the script to fetch and analyze articles. By default, it's set to analyze articles related to "bitcoin". You can change this keyword in the script.

    bashCopy code

    `python sentiment_analysis.py`

2.  Output: The script will print out a summary of the sentiment analysis, including the sentiment of each article and the average sentiment score.

3.  Pine Script Integration: Utilize the average sentiment score in your Pine Script for TradingView to create sentiment-based trading strategies.

Pine Script Setup
-----------------

1.  Data Hosting: Host your sentiment data on a server or a platform like Google Sheets.
2.  Fetching Data in Pine Script: Use the `http_get` function in Pine Script to fetch the sentiment data from your server.
3.  Implement Strategy: Use the fetched sentiment data to make trading decisions in your Pine Script.
